# TF-Siamese-Face-Recognition
<B>The code is implemented using Tensorflow(version 1.14) </B><p>
This is a simple Face recognition model that will predict wether the two images belong to same person or not.<p>
This model is trained to recognize face of 6 different people only but it can be extended to more people also.<p>
Loss Function used in this model is <B>Binary Cross entropy</B> but in code there's <B>Contrastive loss</B> also available to use.<p>
Dataset used for training is AT&T face dataset which can be found at: <href>https://github.com/maheshreddykukunooru/Face_recognition/tree/master/att_faces</href>
